( About `Goal`
  The case 'kicking the ball' again, miku cannot understand kicking the ball, which is not bound to some animation.
  The audiences then properly air 'walk' & 'stop' alternatively and finally a 'kick'.

  The Goal may be determined by the server and then presented to the end users as a Task. As long as a goal is finished,
   next goal will be ready to be dispatched.
